(KEEP ALL COLLIDERS IN THE PREFAB TRIGGER)
 
- Drag the area camera prefab over a section to focus on
- Make sure the VCam's priority are always higher than PlayerCamera
 
- On the parent object, edit the BoxCollider to fit a section of the level. This 
  will act as the trigger for activating a camera in the area.

- Edit the BoundingShape's Polygon2D collider to how you like.
  This will confine the camera to move ONLY within those bounds so that it won't show ahead or show undesired parts.

 - Make sure that the VCam 'Orthographic' (under Lens dropdown) bounds are set so that it won't exceed the size of the BoundingShape. 
Setting the Orthographic to be the same size as BoundingShape will keep the camera completely still for that area. 
You can play with this to make certain cameras zoom in on certain sections of the level if Orthographic is smaller than BoundingShape.
